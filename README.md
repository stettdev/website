## **What is it made of?**

HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I wanted to see how much I can do with the web's baseline and I found out it's quite a lot! Starting from animations through intersection observers to simple page indicators.

I really liked the process of tweaking every small part of the website's behaviour until it was all working well together.
